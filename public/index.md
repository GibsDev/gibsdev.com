``` js
console.log('Hello world!');
```

My name is Curtis, I am a software developer (engineer?) who likes to make things. My current favorite language is Javascript, particularly in a nodejs environment. I try to keep things as simple as possible, but sometimes it is difficult to resist the infamous feature creep.

## About the website

This website uses a simple express server to serve clients with markdown files that have been converted to HTML web pages. Markdown has very little boilerplate so content is easy to create and keeps things nicely organized, so it strikes a good balance between style and functionality. This was the driving factor for creating this website, as I want a simpler way to share my ideas with others (and for my own reference).
