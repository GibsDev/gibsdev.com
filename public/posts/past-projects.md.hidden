# Past projects

This post is dedicated to providing a small summary of some of the projects that I have worked on in the past. In the future, projects like these would each have their own post on the website with a lot more detail. Here I will try to retroactively sumarize some of them and possibly go over some of the problems I had to overcome.

## Password manager

## Ethereum transaction pool listener
