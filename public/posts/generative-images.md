# Generative images using HTML5 canvas

![Generative image 0](/images/generative-0.png)

From early 2021 to 2022 I was deeply involved crypto, specifically Etherum and defi. I learned a lot about NFTs and how they work and what they could be usseful for. Many of the popular NFT projects use some sort of generative code to combine assets into a large number of uniqnue images, and it got me thinking about how I would go about doing that.

An old friend of mine from school regularly posts images on their social media of their artwork. The best way to describe them would be a page full of organic shards of varying sizes. I think the appeal for me is the consistent size and repitition of the shards, but they are still produce a very organic looking image. I had suggested that he try and make them digitally (with scalable vector graphics), but as far as I know he has not tried yet.

This got me thinking about if I could make them digitally. So I opened up Inkscape and had at it. But I'm not much of an artist, and I don't really have the patience for something like this. But I AM willing to spend 20x more time on creating a program that could possibly generate them for me!
