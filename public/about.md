# About me

If you would like a more technical overview, you can find that [here](/experience).

My name is Curtis Gibson, I am a software developer (engineer?) who likes to make things. My current favorite language is Javascript, particularly in a nodejs environment. I like to try and keep things as simple as possible, but sometimes I like to let feature creep roam free.

## Things I like to do

I spend a lot of time on my computer and I'm always trying to stay busy. When I'm not working, you will probably find me doing one of the following:

- Programming a personal project (like this website!)
- Working on a physical building project of anything from woodworking to electronics (and hopfully metal fabrication soon)
- Watching videos on some of the topics I'm interested in:
    - Technology
    - Crypto
    - Building
    - Action sports
    - 3D Printing
- Doing any of my favorite sports:
    - Mountain Biking
    - Skiing
    - Snowboarding
    - Skateboarding
    - Tennis
    - Pool
    - Bowling
- Riding around on 2 wheeled motor vehicles
- Any of the above and probably listening to music at the same time.
